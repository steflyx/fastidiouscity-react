      "Madam President, Mr. Secretary-General, world leaders, ambassadors, and distinguished delegates: " +
      "One year ago, I stood before you for the first time in this grand hall. I addressed the threats facing our world, and I presented a vision to achieve a brighter future for all of humanity. " +
      "Today, I stand before the United Nations General Assembly to share the extraordinary progress we’ve made. " +
      "In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country. " +
      "America’s -- so true. [Laughter] Didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s okay. [Laughter and applause.] " +
      "America’s economy is booming like never before. Since my election, we’ve added $10 trillion in wealth. The stock market is at an all-time high in history, and jobless claims are at a 50-year low. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all achieved their lowest levels ever recorded. We’ve added more than 4 million new jobs, including half a million manufacturing jobs. " +
      "We have passed the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. We’ve started the construction of a major border wall, and we have greatly strengthened border security. " +
      "We have secured record funding for our military -- $700 billion this year, and $716 billion next year. Our military will soon be more powerful than it has ever been before. " +
      "In other words, the United States is stronger, safer, and a richer country than it was when I assumed office less than two years ago. " +
      "We are standing up for America and for the American people. And we are also standing up for the world.",

    text:
      "Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It’s good to be back. As Mitch and Chuck will understand, it’s good to be almost home, down the hall. Anyway, thank you all. " +
      "Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium. No president has ever said those words. And it’s about time. The first lady, I’m her husband. Second gentleman. Chief justice. Members of the United States Congress and the cabinet, distinguished guests. My fellow Americans. " +
      "While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different. A reminder of the extraordinary times we’re in. Throughout our history, presidents have come to this chamber to speak to Congress, to the nation and to the world. To declare war, to celebrate peace, to announce new plans and possibilities. " +
      "Tonight, I come to talk about crisis and opportunity. About rebuilding the nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America. I stand here tonight one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. A hundred days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a nation — we all did — that was in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation, America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility, crisis into opportunity, setbacks to strength. " +
      "We all know life can knock us down. But in America, we never, ever, ever stay down. Americans always get up. Today, that’s what we’re doing. America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear, truth over lies and light over darkness. After 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for a takeoff, in my view. We’re working again, dreaming again, discovering again and leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world that there’s no quit in America. None. " +
      "One hundred days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act. Thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Schumer and the overwhelming support of the American people — Democrats, Independents and Republicans — we did act. Together, we passed the American Rescue Plan, one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We’re already seeing the results. " +
      "We’re already seeing the results. After I promised we would get 100 million Covid-19 vaccine shots into people’s arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million Covid shots in those hundred days, thanks to all the help of all of you. We’re marshaling with your help, everyone’s help, we’re marshaling every federal resource. We’ve gotten vaccinations to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached. We’re setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities. Today, 90 percent of Americans now live within five miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone, is now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away. Go get vaccinated, America. Go and get the vaccination. They’re available. You’re eligible now. " +
      "When I was sworn in on Jan. 20, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against Covid-19. One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protected, fully protected. Senior deaths from Covid-19 are down 80 percent since January, down 80 percent, because of all of you.",

    text:
      "Good morning. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everyone. Fantastic to see you all here. Thank you. Thank you. Let’s get going. Let’s get on with the job. Good morning, everybody listening. So isn’t it amazing to be back here in person? And the first time since so many of you worked to defy the skeptics by winning councils and communities that Conservatives have never won in before, such as Hartlepool. And in fact, it’s the first time since the general election of 2019, when we finally sent that corduroy communist cosmonaut into orbit, where he belongs. " +
      "And why is it that we are back today for a traditional Conservative cheek by jowler? It’s because for months we have had one of the most open economies and societies. And on July the 19th, we decided to open every single theater and every concert hall and nightclub in England. And we knew that some people would still be anxious, so we sent top government representatives to our sweatiest to show that anyone could dance perfectly safely. And wasn’t he brilliant, my friends? Let’s hear it. Let’s hear it for Jon Bon Govi. Living proof that we, you all represent the most jiving, hip, happening and generally funkapolitan party in the world. " +
      "And how have we managed to open up ahead of so many of our friends? You know the answer, it’s because of the rollout of that vaccine. A UK phenomenon, the magic potion invented in Oxford University, bottled in Wales, distributed at incredible speed to vaccination centers everywhere. I saw The Army in action in Glasgow, firing staple guns like carbines as they set up a huge vaccination center. In Fermanagh I saw the needles go in like a collective sewing machine. They vaccinated so rapidly that we were able to do those crucial groups one to four, the oldest and most vulnerable, faster than any other major economy in the world. And though the disease has sadly not gone away, the impact on death rates has been astonishing.",
